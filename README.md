# 🐳 Docker Stacks - HomeLab

This repository contains the stacks I’m starting to use in my HomeLab as part
of my learning journey with Docker and containers. Each service is configured
with Docker Compose and designed for experimenting, automating tasks, and 
improving my skills in system administration and application deployment.
